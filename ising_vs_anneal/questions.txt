What is the solution when x is real and ||x||= 1?
- What does norm mean here?
- What is the relationship between norm and E?
- What are you asking for here?

Frustrated iterative improvement
- Depending on the w, the number of restarts can vary. Is that answer satisfactory? Shall we come up with a number?
- If we should come up with a number, how can we do it?

General
- Where can we find more information in study material about iterative improvement? maybe it's in the book?
